This project implements a recurrent neural network a la WaveNet to create an autoregressor capable of learning styles of solo piano compositions. It is based off of Thomas Angsten's work in his [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-piano-music-with-dilated-convolutional-neural-networks-d81d02e1dda6).
